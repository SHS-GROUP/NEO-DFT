Directions for compiling GAMESS on Unix (any flavor, including any
Linux distribution) can be found at   ~/gamess/machines/readme.unix

The other files here are just backup copies of the scripts, with the
primary versions found at ~/gamess, with one script at ~/gamess/ddi.
It might sometimes be useful to revert to pristine copies of the scripts!
