Building library requires the following:
boost = http://www.boost.org/
cheetah = http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/
hdf5 = http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

Boost distribution must be patched to compile correctly.
boost 1.43, 1.46 patches are located in boost/.
Patch can be applied after or before compiling/installing boost.

When building HDF5, make sure to enable c++ bindings.

The project is configured and built using standard configure command:
./configure [options]
Run ./configure -h to see full list of options

Typical configure command would be:
./configure --prefix=$PWD \
    --with-boost=... \
    --with-mkl \
    --with-gamess --with-integer8 

To disable CUDA:    --without-cuda
To build with MKL:  --with-mkl
To build for Fermi: --with-gpu=fermi

Once configure is done, build and install project:
make -j install

To generate documentation, run:
make doxygen-doc
