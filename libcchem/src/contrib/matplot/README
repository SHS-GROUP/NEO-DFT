Matplot is a collection of templates for plotting vectors and 
matrices similar to plot, surf, contour and quiver in Matlab.

Requirements:
The visualization toolkit, VTK (www.vtk.org)
Tested with VTK5 and g++ 4.2.3

Matrix types need to support indexing with A(i,j). 
Vector types need to support indexing with v[k].

To build the examples, an Scons (www.scons.org) file is provided. 
If you don't want to use Scons, take a look at the SConstruct file 
to figure out the linker flags.

Templates tested with MTL4 (http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/mtl4/) and 
uBLAS (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/index.htm) 
matrices and vectors.

The plotting routines are not completely generic:
Different libraries handle size queries differently. E.g. the number of rows
in a matrix, A, is obtained with num_rows(A) in MTL4 and A.size1() in uBLAS.
To get around this you need to wrap the size functions as is done in mtl4_dims.h
and ublas_dims.h if you plan to use another backend. This file needs to be 
included in matplot.h. Suggestions for a better solution will be warmly 
appreciated. 

The code is documented using Doxygen.
