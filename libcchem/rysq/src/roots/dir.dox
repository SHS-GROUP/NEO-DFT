   @brief Rysq quadrature roots
   @details The roots are implemented up to 13 roots, corresponding to a maximum total angular momentum of quartet of 6.
   The roots between 0 and 5 inclusive are implemented using polynomial approximations over finite regions.
   The general root finding algorithm applicable for roots between 1 and 13 is implemented using Stieltjes method.
   The root finding functions for a number of roots in between 0 and 5 can be called as __device__ functions from CUDA.
