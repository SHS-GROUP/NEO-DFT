to compile the need to have boost libraries installed.
No boost runtime components are required, just the compile time only.

To compile:
make -f Makefile.f

To specify C++ compiler:
make -f Makefile.f CXX=g++

The library produced is libroots.a

to initialize library: 
call rysq_roots_initialize()

to evaluate roots:
call rysq_roots(N, X, t, W)
where input:
N - the number of roots
X - the value
And out put is:
t - roots
W - weights

Library errors are displayed to the standard error

If you are using integer*8 rather than integer*4, compiled with -DINTEGER64, e.g.
make -f Makefile.f CXXFLAGS="-DINTEGER64"

I attached test program, test.cpp
it is built as well, please run it to make sure numbers are correct
e.g.
andrey@nv:~/roots$ ./test
N = 12, X = 0.000000e+00
t = 9.903976e-01, w = 1.234123e-02
t = 9.500958e-01, w = 2.853139e-02
t = 8.803591e-01, w = 4.427744e-02
t = 7.857325e-01, w = 5.929858e-02
t = 6.724033e-01, w = 7.334648e-02
t = 5.477838e-01, w = 8.619016e-02
t = 4.200254e-01, w = 9.761865e-02
t = 2.974846e-01, w = 1.074443e-01
t = 1.881768e-01, w = 1.155057e-01
t = 9.925189e-02, w = 1.216705e-01
t = 3.652642e-02, w = 1.258375e-01
t = 4.103286e-03, w = 1.279382e-01
