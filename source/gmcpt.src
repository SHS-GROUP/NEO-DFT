C  1. Description of GMC-QDPT (and GMC-PT)
C
C     GMC-QDPT (quasidegenerate perturbation theory with general multi-
C     configuration reference functions) is a multistate
C     multiconfiguration PT using general MCSCF/MCCI reference
C     functions.  (Once an active orbital set is chosen, there is no
C     restriction on reference functions.)  It is an extension of
C     MC-QDPT, which is based on CASSCF/CASCI reference functions.
C
C     In some literatures, this form of MRPT (i.e. GMC-QDPT and MC-QDPT)
C     is sometimes referred to as a "diagonalize-then-perturb-then-
C     diagonalize" method.  We first perform MCSCF/MCCI (namely,
C     "diagonalize" the active space Hamiltonian) to obtain reference
C     functions, then "perturb" the reference functions to make the
C     effective Hamiltonian, and then "diagonalize" the effective
C     Hamiltonian to get energies.
C
C     GMC-PT is a term for the cases that GMC-QDPT is applied to a
C     single state.  That is, GMC-PT is a special case name of GMC-QDPT
C     like CISD to MRCISD, HF-SCF to MC-SCF, MRMP to MC-QDPT, etc.
C     (The omitting of QD is because the word QD usually implies
C     "multistate.")
C
C     Notes:
C
C     * "GMC-PT" is sometimes used also as a generic name (which does
C       not specify the number of target states) of GMC-QDPT (as a
C       multistate PT) and GMC-PT (as a single state) for simplicity
C       (shorter name) and for avoiding confusion (QD implies
C       "multistate" as mentioned above).
C
C       As a key-word in GAMESS, "GMCPT" is used rather than "GMCQDPT"
C       because "GMCQDPT" exceeds six letters.

C
C  2. Program for GMC-QDPT
C
C     The present program is based on a scheme that uses matrix elements
C     between the reference and ionized determinants [See Ref.1].  It is
C     different from our original MC-QDPT scheme used in mcqdpt.src,
C     which is based on the Goldstone diagrams, and also different from
C     the original MRMP scheme by Hirao, which uses the matrix elements
C     between CSFs, i.e. the Boys-Reeves formalism with the use of
C     bonded functions.  (Note: It has been sometimes confused recent
C     days, but historically the original MRMP and MC-QDPT computational
C     schemes and codes were developed in different groups at Nagoya and
C     Kyoto at that time, and hence quite independent.)  The current
C     scheme is related to the Kozlowski-Davidson (adopted by Ivanic in
C     demrpt.src) and Celani-Werner schemes.

C
C     NELACT : # of active electrons (default: taken from INFOA)
C     MULT   : Spin multiplicity (default: taken from INFOA)
C    *SZ     : Sz value (default: (MULT-1)/2 )
C     STSYM  : preferred alphanumeric state symmetry specification
C    *ISTSYM : State symmetry of target state(s) (default: 1)
C              the old input table is preserved here to keep a copy.
C           ISTSYM=  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

C        Caution, this table differs from ISTSYM tables in other
C                 places in GAMESS.
C     NMOFZC : # of frozen core orbitals (not correlated in PT
C                                             optimized  in MCSCF)
C              (default: # of chemical cores)
C     NMODOC : # of doubly occupied orbitals (correlated in PT)
C     NMOACT : # of active orbitals
C              (default: taken from DETWFN if defined)
C     NMOFZV : # of frozen virtual orbitals (not correlated in PT)
C              (default: 0)
C
C       You can set NMOCOR(=NMOFZC+NMODOC) instead of NMOFZC and
C       NMODOC.  In this case, NMOFZC becomes # of chemical cores and
C       NMODOC will be computed as NMODOC=NMOCOR-NMOFZC.
C
C       Actually ISTSYM is a 1-d array (ISTSYM(3)).  You can set up to 3
C       symmetries.  This is useful to degenerate states.
C
C    *MOSPN  : Spins of active spin-orbital (1-d array)
C              1: alpha, 2: beta (default: given by the program
C              depending on REFTYP)
C              Do not use!  This option does not affect the results.
C              Only necessary memory size can be changed.
C
C     *** Reference space in GMC-QDPT / MCSCF / MCCI ***
C
C     REFTYP : Type of the reference space
C       MRX (multireference plus excitations) (default)
C         MRX-space consists of parent determinants + 1, 2, ..., NEXCIT
C         excitations.  This choice requires $PDET that specifies parent
C         determinants (see below ["Data-list $PDET"]).
C         Needs also NEXCIT and NPDET.
C       ORMAS (occupation restricted multiple active space)
C         Needs also NSPACE, MSTART, MXHOLE, MXPART, NPDET.
C         (See $ORMAS for details)
C       RAS (restricted active space)
C         Needs MSTART and NEXCIT.
C           Ex. REFTYP=RAS MSTART(1)=4,6,9 NEXCIT=2
C           This example produces a RAS for RAS1=2, RAS2=3,
C           RAS3=NMOACT-2-3
C         (You can make RAS also via ORMAS.)
C      *MRVX (multireference plus various excitations)
C         Similar to MRX, MRVX-space consists of parent determinants +
C         excitations.  However, the excitation level depends on orbital
C         subspace.  This choice requires $PDET that specifies parent
C         determinants (see below ["Data-list $PDET"]).
C         Needs also NSPACE, MSTART, MXHOLE, MXPART, NPDET, and NEXCIT.
C         This space would be rarely used; thus not described precisely.
C         Ask HN for more details.
C      *MRXOS (multireference plus excitations with occupation
C         specified)
C         Needs $PDET, NSPACE, MSTART, MXHOLE, MXPART (MXPART=MXHOLE)
C         NPDET.
C         This space would be rarely used; thus not described.  Ask HN
C         for details.
C
C       Note: MRVX >= MRX >= RAS,  MRXOS >= ORMAS >= RAS
C
C     NPDET  : # of parent determinants (for MRX, MRVX, and MRXOS)
C     NEXCIT : Excitation level (for MRX and RAS)
C     NSPACE, MSTART, MINE, AND MAXE: (same as $ORMAS (See $ORMAS))
C    *MXHOLE/MXPART: Maximum # of holes/particles in each subspace (for
C              MRVX) (1-d array)
C              MXHOLE and MXPART are used with REFTYP=MRVX or MRXOS
C
C     *** Reference space CI ***
C
C     KSTATE : State is used (1) or not (0) (1-d array)
C
C       ex. If you want the second and the fourth roots, set
C           KSTATE(1)=0,1,0,1
C
C    *WSTATE : Weights of the states (1-d array).  (same as $GUGDM2)
C     ISPINA : Spin adaptation (default: 0)
C              0: off, 1: on (strict), -1: on (loose)
C              Proper spin states are automatically picked up after
C              lowest several states of various spins are computed.  So
C              in many cases, you do not have to turn on this option.
C     KFORB  : Canonicalization of MOs
C              T: on, F: off  (default: T)
C              Canonicalization for core, virtual, and invariant-active
C              orbital spaces is necessary to make GMC-QDPT energies
C              uniquely.
C    *KSFORB : Specify if each orbital subspace is canonicalized or not
C              (for MRVX and MRXOS) (1-d array)
C              T: yes, F: no  (default: all F)
C     KNOSYM : Symmetry specification
C              T: off, F: on  (default: F)
C     KNOSPN : Spin specification
C              T: off, F: on  (default: F)
C     MAXBAS : Maximum # of basis vectors in the Davidson method
C              (default: 100)
C     MXITER : Maximum # of iterations in the Davidson method
C              (default: 200)
C     MDI    : Dimension of small Hamiltonian used in setting
C              initial vector(s) in the Davidson method
C              (default: 300)
C    *NSOLUT : # of solutions to be obtained in the Davidson method
C              (In the case of ISPINA=0, the program looks for proper
C              spin states from NSOLUT lowest states of various spins.
C              Increase NSOLUT if the program complains.)
C     THRENE : Threshold for the energy convergence in the Davidson
C              method
C              (default: -1.0d-12 ... Negative value means "off")
C     THRCON : Threshold for the vector convergence in the Davidson
C              method  (default: 1.0d-06)
C
C     *** PT ***
C
C     IWGT   : Wavefunction analysis (default: 1)
C              0: off, 1: on (for external), -1: on (for internal)
C              (Approximate) Reference weight in 1st-order W.F. is
C              computed, which is a good measure for estimate quality of
C              the results.  In many cases, IWGT=1 is preferable to
C              IWGT=-1.  Turn off if you need speed.
C              The definition of the approximate reference weight is
C              given in the relativistic GMC-QDPT paper:
C                M. Miyajima, Y. Watanabe, and H. Nakano, J. Chem. Phys.
C                124, 044101 (2006)
C              The decomposition into orbitals is slightly different
C              from our original (mcqdwt.src).
C     KSZDOE : Electron spin (Sz) dependent orbital energies or not
C              (i.e. use different orbital energy for alpha/beta spin or
C              not)
C              T: on, F: off (default: T)
C     THRWGT : Threshold weight (=|Ci|**2) for determinant selection
C              Give negative value to turn this option off
C              (default: 1.0d-08)
C
C    (Intruder states treatment)
C
C     THRDE  : Threshold for denominator omitting
C              (default: 0.005)
C              Give zero to make this option off
C     EDSHFT : Energy denominator shifts (E -> E + EDSHFT/E)
C              (default: zero shift)
C
C       Each option has each problem: THRDE may give (small)
C       discontinuity because THRDE option just omits small denominator
C       terms; EDSHFT always gives shift-dependent results (even for
C       no-intruder-state cases).
C
C    *THRHDE : Threshold for term omitting ( |<I|V|nu>/dE| )
C              (default: 1.0)
C              This option is not so effective and thus not recommended.
C              Try to improve reference first, using more active
C              orbitals for example.  Possible values are 0.05-0.10
C              because the magnitude of most <I|V|nu>/dE is less than
C              about 0.02-0.03.
C
C    (Misc.)
C
C     CEXCEN : Unit in which the excitation energies are computed
C              eV, cm-1, kcal/mol, kJ/mol
C              (default: eV)
C     DDTFPT : Use DDI transformation or not
C              (default: T)
C              In some cases, the DDI transformation requires much DDI
C              memory.  If DDI transformation failed due to lack of
C              memory, try DDTFPT=F.
C    *GSENE  : 1st/2nd order ground state energies in a.u.
C              (GSENE(1)/GSENE(2)).  Use if you needs excitation
C              energies and E(1) is not the ground state energy. (1-d
C              array)
C              (default: GSENE(1)=0.0, 0.0)
C    *KROT   : (ij)->(ab) rotation [MP2 formula for (ij)->(ab)]
C              T: on, F: off
C              (default: T ; strongly recommended)
C     KMPART : Different orbital energy set for different target state
C              T: on, F: off (default: F)
C              In this case, GMC-QDPT is not based on the standard van
C              Vleck PT, but the multipartitioning PT of Zaitsevskii
C              and Malrieu.  In some cases, this option improves
C              multi-state results.
C    *THRGEN : Threshold for coupling constants.  Most users do not have
C              to care about this option.  Decrease if numerical
C              precision in PT is a problem.  Increase if a user wants
C              speedup. (default: 1.0d-09)
C
C
C     (3) Data-list $PDET ($ADDDET, $REMDET)
C
C     Parent determinant list like:
C       $PDET
C         2200
C         2+-0
C         2-+0
C       $END
C     (This input needs $GMCPT npdet=3 $END)
C     Note that 2+-0 and 2-+0 mean determinants not CSFs.
C     You can put spaces before determinants, but you cannot split
C     determinants by spaces like 22 00.
C
C     You can add/remove some determinants to/from reference:
C       $ADDDET/$REMDET
C         2      <-- # of dets. to be added/removed
C         2002
C         +-02
C       $END
C     though these options $ADDDET and $REMDET would be rarely used.
C     A problem is that $ADDDET can interfere orbital canonicalization.
C     Thus it is much better to use with KFORB=.F.
C
C
C     Notes
C
C     The program was designed for general MC reference functions
C     basically (and originates from relativistic GMC-QDPT program).  So
C     please keep in mind:
C
C     - (A remark on the orbital canonicalization: removed)
C
C     - The program should not be fast compared to the CAS-based
C       programs and other reference-type specific programs.
