To run the 32 bit g77 compiler under a 64 bit x86_64 Linux:
   1. obtain these RPMs (e.g. from rpmfind.net), and install
      them in the order shown:
            libf2c-3.4.4-2.fc3.i386.rpm
            libf2c-3.4.4-2.fc3.x86_64.rpm
            compat-gcc-8-3.3.4.2.x86_64.rpm
            compat-gcc-g77-8-3.3.4.2.x86_64.rpm
      and then,
            ln -s /usr/bin/g77-33 /usr/bin/g77
      Don't be concerned that the library version is higher
      than the gcc and g77 compilers.
      The libraries provided are actually libg2c.so libs!
      Note: this does not clash with a gcc 4.x compiler suite.
   2. modify 'compddi', within the linux32 part,
      change gcc -> gcc33, add -m32 to its CFLAGS
   3. modify 'compall', add -m32 to extraflags for linux32,
      add a line setting CCOMP to gcc33
   4. modify 'comp', within the linux32 part,
      add -m32 to the g77 commmand line
   5. modify 'lked', within the linux32 part,
      add -m32 to the LDOPTS variable.
It is better to use the native 64 bit gfortran, but this will
let you test for f77 level syntactic purity.
