	The Nuclear-Electronic Orbital (NEO) Method
	Developed by the group of Sharon Hammes-Schiffer at
	The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA
	Coded by Simon P. Webb, Tzvetelin Iordanov, Mike Pak,
	Chet Swalina, and Jonathan Skone
 

The NEO approach is designed to incorporate nuclear quantum effects into
electronic structure calculations by treating specified nuclei quantum 
mechanically on the same level as the electrons.  The basic objective of 
this method is the solution of a mixed nuclear-electronic time-independent
Schrödinger equation with molecular orbital methods.  Both electronic and
nuclear molecular orbitals are expressed as linear combinations of Gaussian
basis functions.  The variational method is used to minimize the energy with
respect to all molecular orbitals, as well as the centers of the nuclear basis
functions.  Significant correlation effects among electrons and nuclei are 
included with multiconfigurational and perturbation theory methods.  This
approach is particularly useful for the description of hydrogen transfer and
hydrogen bonding.  For these applications, the hydrogen nuclei, as well as all 
electrons, are treated quantum mechanically.   

The current version of the NEO program in GAMESS includes the NEO-HF 
(Hartree-Fock) and NEO-MP2 (second-order many-body perturbation theory) 
energies, as well as the NEO configuration interaction (NEO-CI),
NEO multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NEO-MCSCF), NEO
nonorthogonal configuration interaction (NEO-NCI), and NEO electron-electron
correlation density functional theory (NEO-DFT(ee)) energies.
Analytical NEO-HF gradients can be used to optimize the positions of the 
classical nuclei and the quantum nuclear basis function centers. 
NEO-HF numerical Hessians are also available.

The NEO method was modified and extended to positron systems for studying mixed
positronic−electronic wavefunctions, replacing the mass of the proton with the
mass of the positron. Within the modified NEO framework, the NEO-HF method
provides the energy corresponding to the single-configuration mixed
positronic−electronic wavefunction, minimized with respect to the molecular
orbitals expressed as linear combinations of Gaussian basis functions. The
electron−electron and electron−positron correlation can be treated in the NEO
framework with NEO-MP2 or multiconfigurational methods such as NEO-FCI and
complete active space self-consistent-field (NEO-CASSCF) methods.  In addition
to implementing these methods for positronic systems, strategies for
calculating electron−positron annihilation rates using NEO-HF, NEO-MP2, and
NEO-FCI wavefunctions were also developed.

Notes for NEO programmers.

The NEO code follows the programming conventions outlined in Section 5 of
the GAMESS manual. Further, for the sake of managable maintenance, the NEO
code has a clean and simple interface with the regular GAMESS code, which 
consists of the minimum possible NEO calls and variables appearing in the 
regular GAMESS source modules. All added NEO code should likewise encroach
as little as possible on the regular GAMESS source code.
