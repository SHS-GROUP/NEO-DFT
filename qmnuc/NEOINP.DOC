                            --- NEO input ---

          The inputs for NEO calculations must use only cartesian
          coordinates in $DATA. The user always must read the 
          vectors (MOREAD) to provide the guess for the electrons.
          If GUESS = MOREAD is not specified this might lead to 
          convergence problems. Other required elements in the 
          input are:
 
          $scf soscf=.f. diis=.t. ethrsh=1.5  $end

          NOTE: if nmomtd=diagzn (SEE $NEO group) then either the 
                diis or soscf convergers may be used.

	  Limitations of this release of the NEO code are:
          1. Analytic gradient based runs are limited to NEO Hartree-Fock 
             methods (analytic second derivatives are not available).
          2. Available energy methods are RHF, ROHF, RHF/MP2, full CI 
             (within a given active space), and MCSCF electrons.
          3. Only determinant based NEO-CI is available.
          4. For CI and MCSCF use of symmetry is not available.
          5. Serial execution only of the code (a parallel version
             will soon follow).
          6. Only Hydrogen nuclei (and positrons with POSNEO=.TRUE.) can be
             treated quantum mechanically.  
          7. The Td point group cannot be used in any type of run.
          8. Positron-electron annihilation rates are limited to MP2
             and FCI methods.

                                                    2-nuclear integrals direct.

                  NOTE: Setting FDIFF=T causes the Fock matrices to be formed
                       incrementally. This allows further integral screening 
                       for the 2-electron integrals employing the Schwartz 
                       inequality and density difference on each iteration. 
                       Only 2-electron integrals can be screened on each 
                       iteration. Mixed integrals cannot be screened because 
                       there are no mixed exchange integrals (obviously). 
                       Remember that the overlap of nuclear basis functions is 
                       usually small so there will be much fewer NON-ZERO mixed
                       and 2-nuclear integrals than there are NON-ZERO 
                       2-electron integrals for most calculations - meaning 
                       that the most efficient implementation of direct scf for 
                       a NEO calculation on a larger system is usually the 
                       combination:

                                   usually retain the the proper symmetry even 
                                   if SYMNUC=.F. The nuclear MOs for systems 
                                   like H2O with 2 quantum protons will only 
                                   retain C2v symmetry if SYMNUC=.T.  

          QMTOLN =           nuclear orbital linear dependence 
                             threshhold used with SYMNUC=.T.      
                             Any functions in the nuclear SALC 
                             variational space whose eigenvalue of the
                             overlap matrix is below this tolerence is
                             considered to be linearly dependent.  
                             Such functions are dropped from the 
                             variational space.  What is dropped is not 
                             individual basis functions, but rather some
                             linear combination(s) of the entire basis
                             set that represent the linear dependent 
                             part of the function space.  The default
                             is 0.0D+00 since the nuclear basis 
                             functions have very little overlap in 
                             most cases.

          NUCOPT =           Flag to request that the positions of all
                             quantum nuclei are optimized. Note that NEO energy
                             gradients are only implemeted for Hartree-Fock
                             methods (electrons and nuclei).

                             For RUNTYP=ENERGY or RUNTYP=GRADIENT in $CONTRL
                             NUCOPT=.T. results in frozen classical atoms and
                             fully optimized quantum nuclei.

                             For RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE in $CONTRL, NUCOPT=.T. results
                             in the quantum nuclei being optimized at each
                             classical nuclei geometry step. This tends to
                             make the geometry optimization expensive
                             with little or no advantage. Therefore, NUCOPT=.F.
                             resulting in a regular geometry optimization
                             scheme is recommended.

                             This option is not available for RUNTYP=SADPOINT,
                             so a regular saddle point search is always 
                             carried out.

                             For RUNTYP=HESSIAN setting NUCOPT=.T. excludes
                             the quantum nuclei coordinates from the Hessian
                             and vibrational analysis. If a Hessian matrix
                             is being calculated for subsequent use in a

          $GESNMO group

          This group controls the selection of the initial nuclear
          molecular orbitals.

          GUESS            Selects type of initial orbital guess.

                 = GESDEN  An initial guess at the nuclear density
                           matrix is made and starting vectors
                           generated from it. It is best to read in
                           converged electronic MOs from a regular
                           SCF (GUESS=MOREAD in $GUESS) in conjunction
                           with GUESS=GESDEN in $GESNMO. 

                 = MOREAD  Read in formatted vectors punched by an
                           earlier run.  This requires a $VECPRO group,
                           and you must pay attention to NORB below.

          NORB   =         The number of orbitals to be read in the
                           $VECPRO group.  This applies only to 
                           GUESS=MOREAD.

          ========================================================= 
          $NEODET group

          This group describes the nuclear determinants to be used in a
          NEO-MCSCF or NEO-CI wavefunction. A number of restrictions
          apply to these types of calculations:

          a) No use of symmetry in NEO-CI. In the case of a NEO-CI 
             following a NEO-HF calculation, symmetry can be used
             for the NEO-HF step, but will be switched off once
             the NEO-CI step starts. For NEO-MCSCF any point group
             symmetry will be switched off once the molecular
             coordinates are generated. 
          b) No nuclear frozen cores are permitted. 
          c) For NEO-MCSCF runs, currently all nuclear MOs must be active,
             i.e. NACT must equal the total number of nuclear MOs.
          d) No information about the overall spin states of the
             eigenvectors of the nuclear-electronic CI Hamiltonian
             is available.
          e) The CI Hamiltonian matrices are formed in memory and a
             full diagonalization is performed. This initial 
             implementation is therefore a memory and cpu hog.
             Future implementations will combine a direct approach
             with a Davidson diagonalization procedure. 


          NACT   = total number of active nuclear orbitals.

          NUCLEI = total number of active nuclei.

          SZ     = azimuthal spin quantum number for each of the
                   nuclear determinants, two times SZ is therefore the
                   number of excess alpha spins in each determinant.
                   The default is SZ=S, extracted from the NUMULT=2S+1
                   given in $NEO.

          NSTATE = Number of NEO-CI states to be found, the default 
                   is 1. The maximum number of states is 100.
                   This value will overide that in $DET or $CIDET.
 
          PRTTOL = Printout tolerance for NEO-CI coefficients, the
                   default is to print any larger than 0.05.
 
          IROOT  = the root whose density is saved on the disk file
                   for subsequent property analysis.  Only one root
                   can be saved, and the default value of 1 means
                   the ground state.  Be sure to set NFLGDM to form
                   the density of the state you are interested in!

          NFLGDM = Controls each state's nuclear AND electronic
                   one-particle density formation.
                   0 -> do not form densities for this state.
                   1 -> form densities and natural orbitals for this
                        state, print and punch occ.nums. and NOs.
                   2 -> same as 1, plus print densities over MOs.
                   The default is NFLGDM(1)=1,0,0,...,0 meaning
                   only ground state electronic and nuclear NOs
                   are generated.
                   During a NEO-MCSCF run, this applies only to
                   the input orbitals and the final converged
                   MCSCF orbitals.
                   This output control will overide that in $DET
                   and $CIDET.
                   
          WSTATE = An array of up to 100 weights to be given to the
                   densities of each state in forming the average.
                   The default is to optimize a pure ground state,
                   WSTATE(1)=1.0,0.0,...,0.0
                   A small amount of the ground state can help the
                   convergence of excited states greatly.
                   Be sure to set NSTATE above appropriately!
 
          IEROOT = the NEO-MCSCF state whose energy will be used 
                   as the desired value.  The default means to use the
                   average (according to WSTATE) of all states as
                   the FINAL energy, which of course is not a
                   physically meaningful quantity.  This is mostly
                   useful for the numerical gradient of a specific
                   state obtained with state averaged orbitals.
                   (default=0). IEROOT is ignored during CI only runs.
                   If IEROOT is set to a nonzero value IROOT (above)
                   will be set to the same value, so the FINAL energy
                   and calculated properties are for the same state.

          This group describes the input to be used for controling 
          a NEO-NCI calculation. See the README-NCI document in the 
          test directory ./neotests/NCI for further information and
          examples of how to use the method.

          A few restrictions apply to this type of calculation:

          a) a NEO-HF calculation must precede the NEO-NCI calculation
             so that atomic orbital integrals are calculated.
             
          b) No use of symmetry in NEO-NCI.
  
          c) Only single excitations possible for electrons and protons
             If you choose to use single excitations they must be 
             specified by arrays IEXE(1) and IEXP(1) for electrons and
             protons, respectively.

                             transformation to use for two electron and two 
                             nuclei integrals. Note the elec-nuc mixed integrals 
                             always use the three-step transformation. It is not
                             recommended that you specify the method to use 
                             since the program will determine on it's own the
                             best method to use for you based on the available
                             resources.
                
                 = 1         three-step transformation (default)
  
                 = 2         two-step transformation. Uses less memory, but is
                             exponentially slower than the first method. 
 
          NUMNCI =           number of NCI states to find. (default is 2)
        
          CUTNCI =           a cutoff for printing the NCI eigenvector coefficients
                             for each state. All coefficents smaller than CUTNCI
                             will not be printed. default(1.0D-2)
 
          NUMEXE =           number of electron single excitations (default is 0) 
                             You must additionally specify the excitations to be 
                             made by including the array IEXE(1) in your input 

          NUMEXP =           number of proton single excitations (default is 0) 
                             You must additionally specify the excitations to be 
                             made by including the array IEXP(1) in your input 
          
          IEXE(1) =          an array that specifies the electronic single excitations
                             to be made. For each electronic excitation there must be 
                             a pair of integers listed for IEXE where the first integer
                             corresponds from which occupied orbital the excitation is 
                             to be made and the second integer specifiying the virtual 
                             orbital to which the electron is excited. If NUMEXE= 2
                             then IEXE(1) could be specified as IEXE(1) = 4,5  4,6  
                             which means that the first excitation is from orbital 4 to 5
                             and the second excitation is from orbital 4 to 6
                             
          IEXP(1) =          an array that specifies the proton single excitations
                             to be made. For each proton excitation there must be 
                             a pair of integers listed for IEXP where the first integer
                             corresponds from which occupied proton orbital the excitation 
                             is to be made and the second integer specifiying the virtual 
                             proton orbital to which the proton is excited. If NUMEXP= 2
                             then IEXP(1) could be specified as IEXP(1) = 1,2  1,9  
                             which means that the first excitation is from orbital 1 to 2
                             and the second excitation is from orbital 1 to 9
          
          NUCFCI =           flag that specifies to do a full CI in the active space of the
                             proton. This option is only valid for a single proton. If this 
                             option is selected then NUMEXP and IEXP(1) do not need to be  
                             specified. default(.FALSE.)
