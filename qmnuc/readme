Compile and Link
----------------
To compile and link the NEO code with regular GAMESS to enable
NEO calculations simply

1. set NEO=true in "compall", and compile as usual.
   If you are adding NEO to GAMESS sometime after compiling the
   standard code, you can simply execute the few "comp" commands
   that you see in "compall", to save some time.
2. set NEO=true in "lked" and link as usual

NEO test jobs
-------------
As well as running the regular GAMESS test jobs in ../gamess/tests
go to ../gamess/qmnuc/neotests and run the NEO test jobs.

The test directories DIRECT, MP2, and SYM contain perl scripts
which will run the jobs and produce a log file with a comparison
of your calculated energy and the correct one.

The test in READBFIN must be run the normal way and requires 
modification of the rungms script to point to the external
basis set file (see readme file in READBFIN directory).

The tests in CI and MCSCF also have to be run the normal way. Expected
results can be found at the top of the input files.
 
The tests for the NEO-DFT(ee) are in the DFT-ee subdirectory of the 
DFT directory. There is a perl script located there which will run all 
of the test jobs. 

The tests for the NEO-NCI method can be found in the NCI directory.
See the README-NCI file there for information on running the NEO-NCI 
test jobs.
