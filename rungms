#
#  This is a C-shell script to execute GAMESS, by typing
#       rungms JOB VERNO NCPUS >& JOB.log &
#  JOB    is the name of the 'JOB.inp' file to be executed,
#  VERNO  is the number of the executable you chose at 'lked' time,
#  NCPUS  is the number of processors to be used.
#
#  Unfortunately execution is harder to standardize than compiling,
#  so you have to do a bit more than name your machine type here:
#
#    a) choose the target for execution from the following list:
#           sockets, mpi, ga, altix, cray-xt, ibm64-sp, sgi64
#       IBM Blue Gene uses separate execution files: ~/gamess/machines/ibm-bg
#
#       choose "sockets" if your compile time target was any of these:
#             axp64, hpux32, hpux64, ibm32, ibm64, linux32,
#             mac32, mac64, sgi32, sun32, sun64
#       as all of these systems use TCP/IP sockets.  Do not name your
#       specific compile time target, instead choose "sockets".
#
#       If your target was 'linux64', you may chose "sockets" or "mpi",
#       according to how you chose to compile.  The MPI example below
#       should be carefully matched against info found in 'readme.ddi'!
#
#       Choose 'ga' if and only if you did a 'linux64' build linked
#       to the LIBCCHEM software for CPU/GPU computations.
#
#           Search on the words typed in capital letters just below
#           in order to find the right place to choose each one:
#    b) choose a directory SCR where large temporary files can reside.
#       This should be the fastest possible disk access, very spacious,
#       and almost certainly a local disk.
#       Translation: do not put these files on a slow network file system!
#    c) choose a directory USERSCR on the file server where small ASCII
#       supplementary output files should be directed.
#       Translation: it is OK to put this on a network file system!
#    d) name the location GMSPATH of your GAMESS binary.
#    e) change the the VERNO default to the version number you chose when
#       running "lked" as the VERNO default, and maybe NCPUS' default.
#    f) make sure that the ERICFMT file name and MCPPATH pathname point to
#       your file server's GAMESS tree, so that all runs can find them.
#       Again, a network file system is quite OK for these two.
#    g) customize the execution section for your target below,
#       each has its own list of further requirements.
#    h) it is unwise to have every user take a copy of this script, as you
#       can *NEVER* update all the copies later on.  Instead, it is better
#       to ask other users to create an alias to point to a common script,
#       such as this in their C-shell .login file,
#             alias gms '/u1/mike/gamess/rungms'
#    i) it is entirely possible to make 'rungms' run in a batch queue,
#       be it PBS, DQS, et cetera.  This is so installation dependent
#       that we leave it to up to you, although we give examples.
#       See ~/gamess/tools, where there are two examples of "front-end"
#       scripts which can use this file as the "back-end" actual job.
#       We use the front-end "gms" on local Infiniband clusters using
#       both Sun Grid Engine (SGE), and Portable Batch System (PBS).
#       See also a very old LoadLeveler "ll-gms" for some IBM systems.

#                     - a typical MPI example -
#
#         This section is customized to two possible MPI libraries:
#             Intel MPI or MVAPICH2 (choose below).
#             We do not know tunings to use openMPI correctly!!!
#         This section is customized to two possible batch schedulers:
#             Sun Grid Engine (SGE), or Portable Batch System (PBS)
#
#         See ~/gamess/tools/gms, which is a front-end script to submit
#         this file 'rungms' as a back-end script, to either scheduler.
#
#                   if you are using some other MPI:
#         See ~/gamess/ddi/readme.ddi for information about launching
#         processes using other MPI libraries (each may be different).
#         Again: we do not know how to run openMPI effectively.
#
#                   if you are using some other batch scheduler:
#         Illustrating other batch scheduler's way's of providing the
#         hostname list is considered beyond the scope of this script.
#         Suffice it to say that
#             a) you will be given hostnames at run time
#             b) a typical way is a disk file, named by an environment
#                variable, containing the names in some format.
#             c) another typical way is an blank separated list in some
#                environment variable.
#         Either way, whatever the batch scheduler gives you must be
#         sliced-and-diced into the format required by your MPI kickoff.
#
if ($TARGET == mpi) then
   #
   #      Besides the usual three arguments to 'rungms' (see top),

   #          of the other MPI choices, so openmpi should not be used!
   #       2. specify your MPI library's top level path just below,
   #          this will have directories like include/lib/bin below it.
   #       3. a bit lower, perhaps specify your ifort path information.

   #  For example, iMPI and MVAPICH2 can choose either "3steps" or "hydra",

   #  Kickoff procedure #1 uses mpd demons, which potentially collide
   #  if the same user runs multiple jobs that end up on the same nodes.

   #  mpiexec, mpdallexit) are needed to run.
   #
   #  Kickoff procedure #2 is little faster, easier to use, and involves
   #  only one command (mpiexec.hydra).  It is called "hydra" here.

#   CRAY-XT (various models) running GAMESS/DDI over MPI wants you to
#      a) set the path to point to the GAMESS executable
#      b) set SMP_SIZE to the number of cores in each XT node
#      c) read the notes below about SCR and USERSCR
#
#   This machine runs only one MPI process/core, with most of these
#   able to be compute processes.  DDI_DS_PER_NODE lets you pick
#   how many of processes are to function as data servers.
#   So a node runs SMP_SIZE minus DDI_DE_PER_NODE compute processes.
#
#   The TPN variable below lets you use more memory, by wasting
#   some of the processors, if that is needed to do your run.
#   The 4th run parameter has to be passed at time of job submission,
#   if not, all cores are used.
#
#   This machine may not allow FORTRAN to access the file server
#   directly.  As a work-around, input data like the error function
#   table can to be copied to the working disk SCR.  Any extra
#   output files can be rescued from USERSCR after the run ends.
#
#   For speed reasons, you probably want to set SCR at the top of this
#   file to /tmp, which is a RAM disk.  Not all data centers will let
#   you do this, and it is acceptable to use the less eficient
#   alternative of setting SCR to a /lustre subdirectory.
#
#   You should set USERSCR to your directory in /lustre, which is
#   visible to all compute nodes, but not as fast as its /tmp.
#   Supplemental output files (like .dat) are then not in a RAM
#   disk which is wiped automatically at job end.
#
#   If you use subgroups, e.g. $GDDI input for FMO runs, you should
#   modify the input copying near the top of this file to copy to
#   USERSCR rather than SCR.  A file in /lustre is visible to all
#   nodes!  You must also change gms-files.csh to define INPUT as
#   being in USERSCR rather than SCR.
