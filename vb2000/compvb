# This compvb file can be altered to help you compile GAMESS/VB2000,
# particularly if you are also using the stand-alone version. It copies 
# the source files from the VB2000 stand-alone directory tree, defined
# by $VB2000PATH, to the GAMESS directory tree, so you should only make
# alterations to the former.
#
# Note that this script assumes that the executable will be gamess.02.x,
# so you need to edit lked to reflect that. I use gamess.01.x for the
# gamess executable with no pluggins.
