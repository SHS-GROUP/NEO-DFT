! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 12.
! This run illustrates optimising the geometry using the Gamess
! NUMGRD facility. If PRINTALL is selected on the command line, its
! effect is cancelled after the first VB step. The molecular orbitals
! are not updated to the VB orbitals for the HF group at any stage. 
! The final output is therefore HF for all MO properties but VB for 
! total wave function properties. The final geometry is length = 0.975 
! (note that ! with C1 symmetry, the two bonds are very slightly 
! different) and the H-H distance is 1.578.
!
! The very final VB energy is:
!
! NSERCH=  6     ENERGY=     -76.0293506
