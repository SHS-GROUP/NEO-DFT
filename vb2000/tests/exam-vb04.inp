! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 4.
! This run is the same as test 3, but illustrates how symmetry 
! can be used to define the data and then switched off. The VB2000
! output is minimised in this case by removing PRINTALL from the 
! VB command line. It also illustrates the visualisation directives,
! $MOLEKEL, $XYZFILE and $GENGRID.
! 
!
! The final RHF energy is:-
!
!  RHF ENERGY IS -74.9630286444 AFTER  11 ITERATIONS
!
! The VB final energy is:-
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER   10 =    -75.00340212     -0.00000048
!
! and the VB and HF dipole moments are 1.6369 and 1.7253 respectively.
!
! GENGRID uses 40 points, which is less than optimal, particularly
! for the core orbital, which would be rarely included in GENGRID 
! data. You might like to raise the number of grid point in each
! direction from 40 to a more realistic 80 or 100.
