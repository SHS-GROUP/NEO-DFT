! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 6.
! This run is similar to test 5, but adds a g function, and reduces the
! number of d and f functions for the sake of run time economy. Note 
! that the g function has to be added to the $DATA group after obtaining
! the rest of the basis from the PUNCH (*.dat) file of a previous run.
! This means that a VBOLIB can not be used as it was in test 5. In 
! practice this basis (2dfg,p) would not be used as it is unbalanced 
! and would be replaced by perhaps (3d2fg,2p), but this makes the test 
! more economical.
!
! The final RHF energy is:-
!
! RHF ENERGY IS -76.0506426605 AFTER  10 ITERATIONS
!
! The final VB energy is:-
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER   11 =    -76.09294991     -0.00000046
!
! and the VB and HF dipole moments are 1.9765 and 2.0860 respectively.
