Changes in the GAMESS/VB2000 test set for version 2.5
-----------------------------------------------------

1. exam-vb09 now reflects the increased functionality of EXETYP=CHECK,
both in the comments and in the extra commands that are there to be
picked up.

2. exam-vb11 now tests the new "SPHER" keyword for spherical harmonics.
The old exam-vb11, is now exam-vb20, with 20, 21 and 22 renamed to 21,
22 and 23. checkvbtst and all the examvb?? have been updated.

3. exam-vb07, exam-vb08 and exam-vb15 now use the built-in cc-pVDZ basis
set. For the last case this is different from the earlier basis set
which only had one d function on S, not 2.

4. All examples that use the cc-pVDZ basis set now have ISPHER=1 in the
$CONTRL block, as since the 2010 version, GAMESS fails if spherical
harmonics are not specified.

Changes in the GAMESS/VB2000 test set for version 2.6
-----------------------------------------------------

1. exam-vb03 now tests the new $MOLDEN directive and exam-vb04 tests the
$GENGRID directive.
