! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 15.
! A test of CH2S with the cc-VDZ basis that has a larger number of 
! primitive Gaussians per contracted function than previous studies.  
! It also demonstrates that even if spherical harmonic d functions, 
! not cartesian d functions, are used in the Gamess run, that the 
! run still works, but cartesian Gaussians are still used in the VB 
! run. Note that spherical harmonics with ISPHER=1 in the $CONTRL 
! block now have to be used for this basis. Note also that this is 
! not using the same basis set as an earlier test 15, which has 
! only 1, not 2, sets of d orbitals on S.
!
! Results are:-
!
! Hartree-Fock Energy from Gamess run =    -436.5273999626
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER    9 =   -436.55972538      0.00000000
!
! The HF and VB dipole moments are 2.2816 and 1.7685 respectively.
