! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 16.
! This run is a restart VB2000 run from test 3, but using SCVB, not VB.
! You may have to edit the file name below $RESTARTFILE in the $VB2000
! block. Note that this run does only one microiteration. 
!
! After running this, you can do a restart by adding RESTART to the $! 
! line, changing the $RESTARTFILE to exam-vb16.V84, and changing the 
! number of macroiterations to say 12. This will complete the 
! calculation. 
!
! Test 17 does this for you.
!
! Note that you must be keeping the scratch files, or at least the 
! *.V84 files on the scratch area.
!
! The final RHF energy is the same as test 3:-
!
!  RHF ENERGY IS      -74.9630286444 AFTER  11 ITERATIONS
!
! The SCVB final energy is:-
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER    1 =    -75.00416898    -75.00416898
! 
! and the VB and HF dipole moments are 1.7253 (HF) and 1.6359 (VB)
