! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 18.
! This run demonstates that the Gamess/VB code can run effective core
! potential calculations, in this case with the SBKJC potential. It
! also tests the CUBE facility by generating small cube files for the
! top two MOs. The number of grid points for the CUBE files is too 
! small for an accurate representation of the orbitals, but it would
! fine if increased from 8 to 80 although take longer to run.
!
! The final RHF energy is:=
!
!  RHF ENERGY IS -10.2742272739 AFTER   9 ITERATIONS
!
! The VB final energy is:-
!
!  ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER    8 =    -10.31300169     -0.00000010
!
! and the VB and HF dipole moments are 1.4404 and 1.4887 respectively.
