! This run is to test if VBTYP=VB2000 is present in the

! checks if there is a $VB2000 block, but it contains no 
! VB2000 command line.
!
! Note that the data has been entered with no symmetry.
!
! VB2000 output terminates before calculating anything much with:-
!

!
! and then terminates normally.
