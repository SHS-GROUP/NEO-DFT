! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 7.
! This run illustrates optimising the geometry using the Gamess 
! TRUDGE facility. Note the compulsory use of COORD=HINT - a real
! pain. The VB dipole is printed at the first step only and the 
! molecular orbitals are not modified at any point for MO properties.
! If PRINTALL is on the command line, its effect is cancelled after 
! the first VB step. The final geometry is length = 0.968 (note that
! with C1 symmetry, the two bonds are very slightly different) and
! the angle is 102.7
!
! The very final VB energy is:
!
! TRUDGE ENERGY VALUE AT NSTEP=  35 IS      -76.0690435928
