! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 3.
! This run is a standard VB2000 run for a closed shell case.
!
! Note that the data has been entered with no symmetry.
!
! The final RHF energy is:=
!
!  RHF ENERGY IS -74.9630286444 AFTER  11 ITERATIONS
!
! The VB final energy is:-
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER   10 =    -75.00340212     -0.00000048
!
! and the VB and HF dipole moments are 1.6369 and 1.7253 respectively.
!
! Note that the populations in each AO, the Mulliken atomic overlap 
! populations and the total Mulliken and Lowdin atomic populations 
! are correct for the VB wavefunction, but that the populations in 
! each MO refer to the Hartree-Fock MOs, but include the changes to
| Hartree-Fock orbitals in a HF group (in this example, MOs 1 -3 ) 
! due to the average field of the VB part of the total wavefunction. 
! Populations of MOs that are part of the VB groups (in this example,
! MOs 4 & 5) remain the original HF populations.
!
! This example also tests the PLTORB, MOLPLT, MOLDEN and CUBE 
! visualisaton routines. See the vb-gamess/README for details.
