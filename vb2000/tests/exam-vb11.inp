! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 11.
! This run tests the new (July 2010) keyword "SPHER" that gives VB
! results over spherical harmonics.
!
! Note that the GAMESS data includes ISPHER=1. This does NOT ensure that 
! spherical harmonics are used during the VB run. It merely ensures that 
! they are used for the GAMESS HF calculation. Integrals over cartesians
! are then passed to VB2000 and the VB run would be cartesian unless the 
! "SPHER" keyword was present. From the May 2010 release of GAMESS,
! ISPHER=1 has to be used for this basis and similar basis sets.
!
! The final RHF energy is:=
!
!  RHF ENERGY IS -76.02403861 AFTER  10 ITERATIONS
!
! The VB final energy is:-
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER   18 =    -76.06688842      0.00000000
!
! and the VB dipole moments is 1.8664 (cf 1.8669 for cartesians). The 
! VB energy with cartesians is -76.06716534.
