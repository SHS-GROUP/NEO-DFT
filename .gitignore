#    This file lists files --not-- to be uploaded into the repository.
#
#    files given without path names are never uploaded,
#          no matter where they occur in the file tree.
#    files with leading stroke means skip in top level of repository only.
#    files with bang explictly include filees that would otherwise be
#          ignored:  !object/int1.o   would cancel a rule about *.o
