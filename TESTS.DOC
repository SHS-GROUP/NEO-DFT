    The GAMESS distribution contains a number of short 
input examples:
   a) in a source code distribution, see
         ~/gamess/tests/standard/exam*.inp
   b) in a binary distribution for Apple Macintosh, see
         ~/gamess/tests/standard/exam*.inp
   c) in a binary distribution for Windows, see
         C:\gamess.64\tests\exam*.inp    (or C:\gamess.32)
Please see the summary table below to note what kinds of 
calculations are included.

   The primary usage of these input files is to introduce 
the basic functionality of the program.  Running all of 
these, and noting where in the log file the key results 
contained in comments in the input files appear should 
introduce the basics to a new user.  After that, explore 
the more exotic keywords in the previous chapter, for the 
number of examples in the test packet is deliberately kept 
small, and each run is relatively simple.

    Secondarily, running these tests serves as a simplistic 
verification of the program's correct installation.  In 
source code distributions, only, there is a script to check 
the numerical results, see
         ~/gamess/tests/standard/checktst
to automatically check all results.  Binary distributions 
can do this by hand, since the expected results are 
contained in the input files.  Note that to keep the tests 
small, the memory and CPU time required is trivially small.  
This means that problems that might occur in larger runs 
won't be detected, and that these tests are entirely 
inappropriate for parallel execution.

    The examples are:
