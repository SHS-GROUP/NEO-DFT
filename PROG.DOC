which are true for all machines.  See the section 'hardware

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation overview
 
    Very specific compiling directions are given in a file 
provided with the GAMESS distribution, namely 
         ~/gamess/misc/readme.unix
and this should be followed closely.  The directions here 
are of a more general nature.

    Before starting the installation, you should also see 
the pages about your computer in the 'Hardware Specifics' 
section of this manual, and at the compiler version notes 
that are kept in the script 'comp'.  There might be some 
special instructions for your machine.

    The first step in installing GAMESS should be to print 
the manual.  If you are reading this, you've got that done!  
The second step would be to get the source code activator 
compiled and linked (note that the activator must be 
activated manually before it is compiled).  Third, you 
should now compile all the quantum chemistry sources. 
Fourth, compile the DDI message passing library, and its 
process kickoff program.  Fifth, link the GAMESS program. 
Finally, run all the short examples provided with GAMESS, 
and very carefully compare the key results shown in the 
'sample input' section against your outputs.  These 
"correct" results are from a IBM RS/6000, so there may be 
very tiny (last digit) precision differences for other 
machines.  That's it!  The rest of this section gives a 
little more detail about some of these steps.

                       * * * * * 

    GAMESS will run on essentially any machine with a 
FORTRAN 77 compiler.  However, even given the F77 standard 
there are still a number of differences between various 
machines.  For example, some chips still use 32 bit 
integers, as primitive as that may seem, while many chips 
allow for 64 bit processing (and hence very large run-time 
memory usage).  It is also necessary to have a C compiler, 
as the message passing library is implemented entirely in 
that language.

    Although there are many types of computers, there is
only one (1) version of GAMESS.
 
    This portability is made possible mainly by keeping 
machine dependencies to a minimum (that is, writing in 
FORTRAN77, not vendor specific language extensions).  The 
unavoidable few statements which do depend on the hardware 
are commented out, for example, with "*I64" in columns 1-4.  
Before compiling GAMESS on a 64 bit machine, these four 
columns must be replaced by 4 blanks.  The process of 
turning on a particular machine's specialized code is 
dubbed "activation".
 
    A semi-portable FORTRAN 77 program to activate the 
desired machine dependent lines is supplied with the GAMESS 
package as program ACTVTE.  Before compiling ACTVTE on your 
machine, use your text editor to activate the very few 
machine dependent lines in ACTVTE before compiling it. Be 
careful not to change the DATA initialization!

                       * * * * *

    The quantum chemistry source code of GAMESS is in the 
directory
             ~/gamess/source
and consists almost entirely of unactivated FORTRAN source 
code, stored as *.src.  There is a bit of C code in this 
directory to implement runtime memory allocation.
 
    The task of building an executable for GAMESS is:
          activate     compile        link
      *.SRC --->  *.FOR  --->  *.OBJ  ---> *.EXE
      source     FORTRAN       object    executable
       code        code         code       image
where the intermediate files *.FOR and *.OBJ are discarded 
once the executable has been linked.  It may seem odd at 
first to delete FORTRAN code, but this can always be 
reconstructed from the master source code using ACTVTE.
 
    The advantage of maintaining only one master version is 
obvious.  Whenever any improvements are made, they are 
automatically in place for all the currently supported 
machines.  There is no need to make the same changes in a 
plethora of other versions.

                       * * * * *

    The Distributed Data Interface (DDI) is the message 
passing layer, supporting the parallel execution of GAMESS. 
It is stored in the directory tree
             ~/gamess/ddi
It is necessary to compile this software, even if you don't 
intend to run on more than one processor.  This directory 
contains a file readme.ddi with directions about compiling, 
and customizing your computer to enable the use of System V 
memory allocation routines.  It also has information about 
some high end parallel computer systems.

                       * * * * *

    The control language needed to activate, compile, and 
link GAMESS on your brand of computer involves several 
scripts, namely:
    COMP    compiles a single quantum chemistry module.
    COMPALL compiles all quantum chemistry source modules.
    COMPDDI compiles the distributed data interface, and
            generates a process kickoff program, ddikick.x.
    LKED    link-edit (links) together quantum chemistry
            object code, and the DDI library, to produce a
            binary executable gamess.x.
    RUNGMS  runs a GAMESS job, in serial or parallel.
    RUNALL  uses RUNGMS to run all the example jobs.
There are files related to some utility programs:
    MBLDR.*      model builder (internal to Cartesian)
    CARTIC.*     Cartesian to internal coordinates
    CLENMO.*     cleans up $VEC groups
    DK3.F        prepare relativistic AO contractions.
There are files related to two-D X-windows graphics, in:
             ~/gamess/graphics
Better back-end graphics (3D as well as 2D) is available in 
the MacMolPlt program, now available for all popular 
desktop operating systems.




Running Distributed Data Parallel GAMESS

    GAMESS consists of many FORTRAN files implementing its 
quantum chemistry, and some C language files implementing 
the Distributed Data Interface (DDI).  The directions for 
compiling DDI, configuring the system parameters to permit 
execution of DDI programs, and how to use the 'ddikick.x' 
program which "kicks off" GAMESS processes may be found in 
the file readme.ddi.  If you are not the person installing 
the GAMESS software, you can skip reading that.

    Efficient use of GAMESS requires an understanding of 
three critical issues:  The first is the difference between 
two types of memory (replicated MWORDS and distributed 
MEMDDI) and how these relate to the physical memory of the 
computer which you are using.  Second, you must understand 
to some extent the degree to which each type of computation 
scales so that the proper number of CPUs is selected. 
Finally, many systems run -two- GAMESS processes on every 
processor, and if you read on you will find out why this is 
so.

    Since all code needed to implement the Distributed Data
Interface (DDI) is provided with the GAMESS source code
distribution, the program compiles and links ready for 
parallel execution on all machine types.  Of course, you
may choose to run on only one processor, in which case
GAMESS will behave as if it is a sequential code, and the
full functionality of the program is available.

parallelization history

    We began to parallelize GAMESS in 1991 as part of the
joint ARPA/Air Force piece of the Touchstone Delta project.
Today, nearly all ab initio methods run in parallel, 
although some of these still have a step or two running
sequentially only.  Only the RHF+CI gradients have no
parallel method coded.  We have not parallelized the semi-
empirical MOPAC runs, and probably never will.  Additional
parallel work occurred as a result of a DoD CHSSI software
initiative in 1996. This led to the DDI-based parallel
RHF+MP2 gradient program, after development of the DDI
programming toolkit itself.  Since 2002, the DoE program
SciDAC has sponsored additional parallelization.  The DDI
toolkit has been used since its 1999 introduction to add
codes for UHF+MP2 gradient, ROHF+ZAPT2 energy, and MCSCF
wavefunctions as well as their analytic Hessians or MCQDPT2
energy correction.
 
    In 1991, the parallel machine of choice was the Intel
Hypercube although small clusters of workstations could
also be used as a parallel computer.  In order to have
the best blend of portability and functionality, we chose
in 1991 to use the TCGMSG message passing library rather
than one of the early vendor's specialized libraries.  As
the major companies began to market parallel machines, and
as MPI version 1 emerged as a standard, we began to use
MPI on some equipment in 1996, while still using the very
resilient TCGMSG library on everything else.  However, in
June 1999, we retired our old friend TCGMSG when the
message passing library used by GAMESS changed to the
Distributed Data Interface, or DDI.  An SMP-optimized
version of DDI was included with GAMESS in April 2004.

    Three people have been extremely influential upon the
current parallel methodology.  Theresa Windus, a graduate
student in the early 1990s, created the first parallel 
versions.  Graham Fletcher, a postdoc in the late 1990s,
is responsible for the addition of distributed data
programming concepts.  Ryan Olson rewrote the DDI software
in 2003-4 to support the modern SMP architectures well, and
this was released in April 2004 as our standard message
passing implementation.

DDI compute and data server processes

    DDI contains the usual parallel programming calls, such
as initialization/closure, point to point messages, and
the collective operations global sum and broadcast.  These
simple parts of DDI support all parallel methods developed
in GAMESS from 1991-1999, which were based on replicated
storage rather than distributed data.  However, DDI also
contains additional routines to support distributed memory
usage.

    DDI attempts to exploit the entire system in a scalable 
way.  While our early work concentrated on exploiting the 
use of p processors and p disks, it required that all data 
in memory be replicated on every one of the p CPUs.  The 
use of memory also becomes scalable only if the data is 
distributed across the aggregate memory of the parallel 
machine.  The concept of distributed memory is contained in 
the Remote Memory Access portion of MPI version 2, but so 
far MPI-2 is not available from American computer vendors. 
The original concept of distributed memory was implemented 
in the Global Array toolkit of Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory (see http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/pub/docs/global).
 
    Basically, the idea is to provide three subroutine 
calls to access memory on other processors (in the local or 
even remote nodes): PUT, GET, and ACCUMULATE.  These give 
access to a class of memory which is assumed to be slower 
than local memory, but faster than disk:

    <--- fastest                           slowest --->
 registers cache(s) local_memory remote_memory disks tapes
    <--- smallest                          biggest --->

Because DDI accesses memory on other CPUs by means of an
explicit subroutine call, the programmer is aware that a
message must be transmitted.  This awareness of the access
overhead should encourage algorithms that transfer many
data items in a single message.  Use of a subroutine call
to reach remote memory is a recognition of the non-uniform
memory access (NUMA) nature of parallel computers.  In
other words, the Distributed Data Interface (DDI) is an
explicitly message passing implementation of global shared
memory.  

    In order to have one CPU pass data items to a second 
CPU when the second CPU needs them, without significant 
delay, the computing job on the first CPU must interrupt 
its computation briefly to furnish the data.  This type of 
communication is referred to as "one sided messages" or 
"active messages" since the first CPU is an unwitting 
participant in the process, which is driven entirely by the 
requirements of the second CPU.



    The Cray T3E has a library named SHMEM to support this
type of one sided messages (and good hardware support for
this too) so, on the T3E, GAMESS runs as a single process
per CPU.  Its memory image looks like this:

            node 0           node 1
              p=0              p=1
        ---------------   ---------------
        |    GAMESS   |   |    GAMESS   |
        |   quantum   |   |   quantum   |
        |  chem code  |   |  chem code  |
        ---------------   ---------------
        |  DDI code   |   |  DDI code   |
        ---------------   ---------------  input keywords:
        |  replicated |   | replicated  |       <-- MWORDS
        |  data       |   | data        |
    -----------------------------------------
    |   |             |   |             |   |   <-- MEMDDI
    |   |  distributed|   | distributed |   |
    |   |  data       |   | data        |   |
    |   |             |   |             |   |
    |   |             |   |             |   |
    |   |             |   |             |   |
    |   ---------------   ---------------   |
    -----------------------------------------

where the box drawn around the distributed data is meant to 
imply that a large data array is residing in the memory of 
all processes (in this example, half on one and half on the 
other).

    Note that the input keyword MWORDS gives the amount of 
storage used to duplicate small matrices on every CPU, 
while MEMDDI gives the -total- distributed memory required 
by the job.  Thus, if you are running on p CPUs, the memory 
that is used on any given CPU is 

       total on any 1 CPU = MWORDS + MEMDDI/p

Since MEMDDI is very large, its units are in millions of 
words.  Since good execution speed requires that you not 
exceed the physical memory belonging to your CPUs, it is 
important to understand that when MEMDDI is large, you will 
need to choose a sufficiently large number of CPUs to keep 
the memory on each reasonable.

    To repeat, the DDI philosophy is to add more processors
not just for their compute performance or extra disk space,
but also to aggregate a very large total memory.  Bigger
problems will require more CPUs to obtain sufficiently
large total memories!  We will give an example of how you
can estimate the number of CPUs a little ways below.

    If the GAMESS task running as process p=1 in the above 
example needs some values previously computed, it issues a  
call to DDI_GET.  The DDI routines in process p=1 then  
figure out where this "patch" of data actually resides in 
the big rectangular distributed storage.  Suppose this is 
on process p=0.  The DDI routines in p=1 send a message to 
p=0 to interupt its computations, after which p=0 sends a 
bulk data message to process p=1's buffer.  This buffer 
resides in part of the replicated storage of p=1, where 
computations can occur.  Note that the quantum chemistry 
layer of process p=1 was sheltered from most of the details 
regarding which CPU owned the patch of data that process 
p=1 wanted to obtain.  These details are managed by the DDI 
layer.

    Note that with the exception of DDI_ACC's addition of 
new terms into a distributed array, no arithmetic is done 
directly upon the distributed data.  Instead, distributed 
data is accessed only by DDI_GET, DDI_PUT (its counterpart 
for storage of data items), and DDI_ACC (which accumulates 
new terms into the distributed data).  DDI_GET and DDI_PUT 
can be thought of as analogous to FORTRAN READ and WRITE 
statements that transfer data between disk storage and 
local memory where computations may occur.

    It is the programmer's challenge to minimize the
number of GET/PUT/ACC calls, and to design algorithms that
maximize the chance that the patches of data are actually
within the local CPU's portion of the distributed data.



    Since the SHMEM library is available only on a few
machines, all other platforms adopt the following memory
model, which involves ?two- GAMESS processes running on
every processor:

            node 0           node 1
              p=0              p=1

    -----------------------------------------

The first half of the processes do quantum chemistry, and 
the X indicates that they spend most of their time 
executing some sort of chemistry.  Hence the name "compute 
process".  Soon after execution, the second half of the 
processes call a DDI service routine which consists of an 
infinite loop to deal with GET, PUT, and ACC requests until 
such time as the job ends.  The X shows that these "data 
servers" execute only DDI support code.  (This makes the 
data server's quantum chemistry routines the equivalent of 
the human appendix).  The whole problem of interupts is now 
in the hands of the operating system, as the data servers 
are distinct processes.  To follow the same example as 
before, when the compute process p=1 needs data that turns 
out to reside on process 0, a request is sent to the data 
server p=2 to transfer information back to the compute 
process p=1.  The compute process p=0 is completely unaware 
that such a transaction has occurred.
 
    The formula for the memory required by any single CPU 
is unchanged, if p is the total number of CPUs used,
       total on any 1 CPU = MWORDS + MEMDDI/p.

    As a technical matter, if you are running on a system 
where all processors are in the same node (the SGI Altix is 
an example), or if you are running on an IBM SP where LAPI 
assists in implementing one-sided messaging, then the data 
server processes are not started.  The memory model in the 
illustration above is correct, if you just mentally omit 
the data server processes from it.  In all cases, where the 
SHMEM library is not used, the distributed arrays are 
created by System V memory calls, shmget/shmat, and their 
associated semaphore routines.  Your system may need to be 
reconfigured to allow allocation of large shared memory 
segments, see 'readme.ddi' for more details.

    The parallel CCSD and CCSD(T) programs add a third kind 
of memory to the mix: node-replicated.  This is data (e.g. 
the doubles amplitudes) that is stored only once per node.  
Thus, this is more copies of the data than once per 
parallel job (fully distributed MEMDDI) but fewer than once 
per CPU (replicated MWORDS).  A picture of the memory model 
for the CCSD(T) program can be found in the "readme.ddi" 
file, so is not duplicated here.  There is presently no 
keyword for this type of memory, but the system limit on 
the total SystemV memory does apply.  It is important to 
perform a check run when using CCSD(T) and carefully follow 
the printout of its memory requirements.

memory allocations and check jobs

    At present, not all runs require distributed memory. 
For example, in an SCF computation (no hessian or MP2 to 
follow) the memory needed is on the order of the square of 
the basis set size, for such quantities as the orbital 
coefficients, density, Fock, overlap matrices, and so on. 
These are simply duplicated on every CPU in the MWORDS (or 
the older keyword MEMORY in $SYSTEM) region.  In this case 
the data server processes still run, but are dormant 
because no distributed memory access is attempted.

    However, closed and open shell MP2 calculations, MCSCF 
wavefunctions, and their analytic hessian or MCQPDT energy 
correction do use distributed memory when run in parallel. 
Thus it is important to know how to obtain the correct 
value for MEMDDI in a check run, and how to compute how 
many CPUs are needed to do the run.

    Check runs (EXETYP=CHECK) need to run quickly, and the 
fastest turn around always comes on one CPU only.  Runs 
which do not currently exploit MEMDDI distributed storage 
will formally allocate their MWORDS needs, and feel out 
their storage needs while skipping almost all of the real 
work.  Since MWORDS is replicated, the amount that is 
needed on 1 CPU remains unchanged if you later do the true 
computation on more than 1 CPU.

    Check jobs which involve MEMDDI storage are a little 
bit trickier.  As noted, we want to run on only 1 CPU to 
get fast turn around.  However, MEMDDI is typically a large 
amount of memory, and this is unlikely to be  available on 
a single CPU.  The solution is that the check job will not 
actually allocate the MEMDDI storage, instead it just 
remembers what you gave as input and checks to see if this 
will be adequate.  As someone once said, MEMDDI is a "fairy 
tale number" during a check job.  So, you can input a big 
value like MEMDDI=25000 (25,000 million words is equal to 
25,000 * 1,000,000 * 8 = 200 GBytes) and run this check job 
on a computer with only 1024 MB = 1 GB of memory per 
processor.  Let us say that a closed shell MP2 check run 
for this case gives the output of
  SCALED *PER-NODE* MEMORY REQUIREMENT
  NODES  DISTRIBUTED/MWORDS  REPLICATED/WORDS TOTAL/MBYTES
    1         952                7284508          7624
The real run requires MWORDS=8 MEMDDI=960.  Note that we 
have just rounded up a bit from the 7.3 and 952 in this 
output, for safety.

    Of course, the actual computation will have to run on a 
large number of such processors, because you don't have 200 
GB on your CPU, we are assuming 1024 MB (1 GB).  Let us 
continue to compute how many processors are needed.  We 
need to reserve some memory for the operating system (25 
MB, say) and for the GAMESS program and local storage (let 
us say 50 MB, for GAMESS is a big program, and the compute 
processes should be swapped into memory).  Thus our 
hypothetical 1024 MB processor has 950 MB available, 
assuming no one else is running. In units of words, this 
machine has 950/8 = 118 million words available for your 
run.  We must choose the number of processors p to satisfy
                 needed <= available
      MWORDS + MEMDDI/p <= free physical memory
              8 + 960/p <= 118
so solving for p, we learn this example requires p >= 9 
compute processes.  The answer for roughly 8 GB of 
distributed memory on 1 GB processors was not 8, because 
the O/S, GAMESS itself, and the MWORDS requirements 
together mean less than 1 GB could be contributed to the 
distributed total.  More CPUs than 9 do not require 
changing MWORDS or MEMDDI, but will run faster than 9.  
Fewer CPUs than 9 do not have enough memory to run!

    One more subtle point about CHECK runs with MEMDDI is 
that since you are running on 1 CPU only, the code does not 
know that you wish to run the parallel algorithm instead of 
the sequential algorithm.  You must force the CHECK job 
into the parallel section of the program by
 $system parall=.true. $end
There's no harm leaving this line in for the true runs, as 
any job with more than one compute process is parallel 
regardless of the input keyword PARALL.

    The check run for MCQDPT jobs will print three times
a line like this
   MAXIMUM MEMDDI THAT CAN BE USED IN ... IS x MWORDS
Typically the 2nd such step, transforming over all 
occupied and virtual canonical orbitals, will be the
largest of the three requirements.  Its size can be
guesstimated before running, as
   (Nao*Nao+Nao)/2 * ((Nocc*Nocc+Nocc)/2 + Nocc*Nvirt)
where Nocc = NMOFZC+NMODOC+NMOACT, Nvirt=NMOEXT, and
Nao is the size of the atomic basis.  Unlike the closed
shell MP2 program, this section still does extensive
I/O operations even when MEMDDI is used, so it may be
useful to consider the three input keywords DOORD0,
PARAIO, and DELSCR when running this code.


representative performance examples

    This section describes the way in which the various 
quantum chemistry computations run in parallel, and shows 
some typical performance data.  This should give you as the 
user some idea how many CPUs can be efficiently used for 
various SCFTYP and RUNTYP jobs

    The performance data you will see below were obtained 
on a 16 CPU Intel Pentium II Linux (Beowulf-type) cluster 
costing $49,000, of which $3,000 went into the switched 
Fast Ethernet component.  512 MB/CPU means this cluster has 
an aggregate memory of 8 GB.  For more details, see
    http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/GAMESS/dist.pc.shtml.
This is a low quality network, which exposes jobs with 
higher communication requirements, by noting when the wall 
time is much longer than the CPU.

                         ---

    The HF wavefunctions can be evaluated in parallel using 
either conventional disk storage of the integrals, or via 
direct recomputation of the integrals.  Some experimenting 
will show which is more effective on your hardware.  As an 
example of the scaling performance of RHF, ROHF, UHF, or 
GVB jobs that involve only computation of the energy or its 
gradient, we include here a timing table from the 16 CPU PC 
cluster. The molecule is luciferin, which together with the 
enzyme luciferase is involved in firefly light production.  
The chemical formula is C11N2S2O3H8, and RHF/6-31G(d) has 
294 atomic orbitals.  There's no molecular symmetry.  The 
run is done as direct SCF, and the CPU timing data is

                   p=1   p=2   p=4   p=8  p=16
   1e- ints        1.1   0.6   0.4   0.3   0.2

   total wall     7107  3562  1815   950   522 seconds

Note that direct SCF should run with the wall time very 
close to the CPU time as there is essentially no I/O and 
not that much communication (MEMDDI storage is not used by 
this kind of run).  Running the same molecule as 
DFTTYP=B3LYP yields

                   p=1   p=2   p=4   p=8  p=16
   1e- ints        1.1   0.7   0.3   0.3   0.2

   total wall    21348 10698  5368  2758  1477

and finally if we run an RHF analytic hessian, using AO

CPU speedups for 1->16 processors for RHF gradient, DFT 
gradient, and RHF analytic hessian are 14.4, 15.8, and 15.1 
times faster, respectively.  The wall clock times are close 
to the CPU time, indicating very little communication is 
involved.  If you are interested in an explanation of how 
the parallel SCF is implimented, see the main GAMESS paper,

    The CIS energy and gradient code is also programmed to 
have the construction of Fock-like matrices as its 
computational kernel.  Its scaling is therefore very 
similar to that just shown, for porphin C20N4H14, DH(d,p)

    For the next type of computation, we discuss the MP2 
correction.  For closed shell RHF + MP2 and unrestricted 
UHF + MP2, the gradient program runs in parallel using 
distributed memory, MEMDDI.  In addition, the ROHF + MP2 
energy correction for OSPT=ZAPT runs in parallel using 
distributed memory, but OSPT=RMP does not use MEMDDI in 
parallel jobs.  All distributed memory parallel MP2 runs 
resemble RHF+MP2, which is therefore the only example given 
here.

   The example is a benzoquinone precursor to hongconin, a 
cardioprotective natural product.  The formula is C11O4H10, 
and 6-31G(d) has 245 AOs.  There are 39 valence orbitals 
included in the MP2 treatment, and 15 core  orbitals.  
MEMDDI must be 156 million words, so the memory computation 
that was used above tells us that our 512 MB/CPU PC cluster 
must have at least three processors to aggregate the 
required MEMDDI.  MOREAD was used to provide converged RHF 
orbitals, so only 3 RHF iterations are performed.  The 
timing data are CPU and wall times (seconds) in the 1st/2nd 
lines:

       CPU speedup      4.04    3.98
       wall speedup     3.43    3.40

The wall clock time will be closer to the CPU time if the 
quality of the network between the computer is improved 
(remember, this run used just switched Fast Ethernet).  As 
noted, the number of CPUs is more influenced by a need to 
aggregate the necessary total MEMDDI, more than by concerns 
about scalability.  MEMDDI is typically large for MP2 
parallel runs, as it is proportional to the number of 
occupied orbitals squared times the number of AOs squared.

program, see

    The next type of computation we will consider is 
analytic computation of the nuclear Hessian (force constant 
matrix).  The performance of the RHF program, based on AO 
integrals, was given above, as its computational kernel 
(Fock-like builds) scales just as the SCF itself.  However, 
for high spin ROHF, low spin open shell SCF and TCSCF (both 
done with GVB), the only option is MO basis integrals.  The 
integral transformation is parallel according to
    T.L.Windus, M.W.Schmidt, M.S.Gordon
       Theoret.Chim.Acta  89, 77-88(1994).
It distributes 'passes' over processors, so as to 
parallelize the transformation's CPU time but not the 
replicated memory, or the AO integral time.  Finally the 
response equation step is hardly parallel at all.  The test 
example is an intermediate in the ring opening of 
silacyclobutane, GVB-PP(1) or TCSCF, 180 AOs for 6-
311G(2d,2p):
                     p=1    p=2     p=4    p=8   p=16
   2e- ints           83     42      21     11      5

   total wall       6532   3538    2072   1399   1108

Clearly, the final response equation (CPHF) step is a 
sequential bottleneck, as is the fact that the orbital 
hessian in this step is stored entirely on the disk space  
of CPU 0.  Since the integral transformation is run in 
replicated MWORDS memory, rather than distributing this, 
and since it also needs a duplicated AO integral file be 
stored on every CPU, the code is clearly not scalable to 
very many processors.  Typically we would not request more 
than 3 or 4 processors for an analytic ROHF or GVB hessian.

   The final analytic hessian type is for MCSCF.  The 
scalability of the MCSCF wavefunction will be given just 
below, but the response equation step for MCSCF is clearly 
quite scalable.  The integral transformation for the 
response equation step uses distributed memory MEMDDI, and 
should scale like the MP2 program (documented above).  The 
test case has 8e- in 8 orbitals, and the time reflect this, 
with most of the work involving the 4900 determinants.  
Total speedup for 4->16 is 4.11, due to luckier work 
distributing for 16 CPUs:

                      p=4      p=16
   MCSCF wfn        113.5     106.1

   total CPU     118430.8   28747.6
   total wall    119766.0   30746.4

This code can clearly benefit from using many processors, 
with scalability of the MCSCF step itself almost moot.

                         ---

   Now lets turn to MCSCF energy/gradient runs.  We will 
illustrate two convergers, SOSCF and then FULLNR.  The 
former uses a 'pass' type of integral transformation (ala 
the GVB hessian job above), and runs in replicated memory 
only (no MEMDDI).  The FULLNR converger is based on the MP2 
program's distributed memory integral transformation, so it 
uses MEMDDI.  In addition, the parallel implementation of 
the FULLNR step never forms the orbital hessian explicitly, 
doing Davidson style iterations to predict the new 
orbitals.  Thus the memory demand is almost entirely 
MEMDDI.

   The example we choose is at a transition state for the 
water molecule assisted proton transfer in the first 
excited stat of 7-azaindole.  The formula is C7N2H6(H2O), 
there are 190 active orbitals, and the active space is the 
10 pi electrons in 9 pi orbitals of the azaindole portion.  
There are 15,876 determinants used in the MCSCF 
calculation, and 5,292 CSFs in the perturbation calculation 
to follow.  See Figure 6 of G.M.Chaban, M.S.Gordon  
J.Phys.Chem.A 103, 185-189(1999) if you are interested in 
this chemistry.  The timing data for the SOSCF converger

   total wall    28,290  20,719   12,866   8,292   5,583

The first iteration is broken down into its primary steps 
from the integral transformation to the orbital update, 
inclusive.  The SOSCF program is clearly faster, and should 
be used when the number of processors is modest (say up to 
8), however the largest molecules will benefit from using 
more processors and the much more scalable FULLNR program.

   One should note that the CI calculation was more or less 
serial here.  This data comes from before the ALDET and 
ORMAS codes were given a replicated memory parallization, 
so scaling in the CI step should now be OK, to say 8 or 16 
CPUs.  However, these two CI code's use of replicated 
memory in the CI step limits MCSCF scalability in the large 
active space limit.

   Now let's consider the second order pertubation 
correction for this example.  As noted, it is an excited 
state, so the test corrects two states simultaneously (S0 
and S1).  The parallel multireference perturbation program 
is described in 
  H.Umeda, S.Koseki, U.Nagashima, M.W.Schmidt
      J.Comput.Chem. 22, 1243-1251 (2001)
The run is given the converged S1 orbitals, so that it can 
skip directly to the perturbation calculation:
                 p=1     p=2      p=4     p=8    p=16
   2e- ints      332     332      329     328     331
   MCQDPT      87921   43864    22008   11082    5697
               -----   -----    -----   -----   -----
   total CPU   88261   44205    22345   11418    6028
   total wall  91508   45818    23556   12350    6852
This corresponds to a speedup for 1->16 of 14.6.

                         ---

    In summary, most ab initio computations will run in 
less time on more than one processor.  However, some things 
can be run only on 1 CPU, namely
   semi-empirical runs
   RHF+CI gradient
   Coupled-Cluster calculations
Some steps run with little or no speedup, forming 
sequential bottlenecks that limit scalability.  They do not 
prevent jobs from running in parallel, but restrict the 
total number of processors that can be effectively used:
   ROHF/GVB hessians: solution of response equations
   MCSCF: Hamiltonian and 2e- density matrix (CI)
   energy localizations: the orbital localization step
   transition moments/spin-orbit: the final property step
   MCQDPT reference weight option
Future versions of GAMESS will address these bottlenecks.  

   A short summary of the useful number of CPUs (based on 
data like the above) would be

Altering program limits

    Almost all arrays in GAMESS are allocated dynamically, 
but some variables must be held in common as their use is 
ubiquitous.  An example would be the common block /NSHEL/ 
which holds the ab initio atom's basis set.  The following 
Unix script, which we call 'mung' (see Wikipedia entry for 
recursive acronyms), changes the PARAMETER statements that 
set various limitations:

#!/bin/csh
#
#       automatically change GAMESS' built-in dimensions
#
chdir /u1/mike/gamess/source
#
foreach FILE (*.src)
   set FILE=$FILE:r
   echo ===== redimensioning in $FILE =====
   echo "C dd-mmm-yy - SELECT NEW DIMENSIONS" \
             > $FILE.munged
   sed -e "/MXATM=2000/s//MXATM=500/" \
       -e "/MXAO=8192/s//MXAO=2047/" \
       -e "/MXGSH=30/s//MXGSH=30/" \
       -e "/MXSH=5000/s//MXSH=1000/" \
       -e "/MXGTOT=20000/s//MXGTOT=5000/" \
       -e "/MXRT=100/s//MXRT=100/" \
       -e "/MXFRG=1050/s//MXFRG=65/" \
       -e "/MXDFG=5/s//MXDFG=1/" \
       -e "/MXPT=2000/s//MXPT=100/" \
       -e "/MXFGPT=12000/s//MXFGPT=2000/" \
       -e "/MXSP=500/s//MXSP=100/" \
       -e "/MXTS=20000/s//MXTS=2500/" \
       -e "/MXABC=6000/s//MXABC=1/" \
       $FILE.src >> $FILE.munged
   mv $FILE.munged $FILE.src
end
exit

    The script shows how to reduce memory, by decreasing 
the number of atoms and basis functions, and reducing the 
storage for the effective fragment and PCM solvent models.

    Of course, the 'mung' script can also be used to 
increase the dimensions!

    To fully turn off effective fragment storage, use 
MXFRG=4, MXDFG=1, MXPT=8, MXFGPT=4.  To fully turn off PCM 
storage, use MXSP=1, MXTS=1.  The parameters currently used 
for GAMESS imply about 75 MBytes of storage tied up in 
common blocks, which is not unreasonable, even in a laptop.  
Reducing the storage size makes sense mainly on microkernel 
type systems, without virtual memory managers.

In this script,
   MXATM = max number of ab initio atoms
   MXAO  = max number of basis functions
   MXGSH = max number of Gaussians per shell
   MXSH  = max number of symmetry unique shells
   MXGTOT= max number of symmetry unique Gaussians

   MXRT  = max number of MCSCF/CI states

   MXFRG = max number of effective fragment potentials
   MXDFG = max number of different effective fragments
   MXPT  = max number of points in any one term of any EFP
   MXFGPT= maximum storage for all EFPs, and is sized for
           a large number of EFPs with a small number of
           points (solvent applications), or a smaller
           number of EFPs with many points (biochemistry).

   MXSP  = max number of spheres (sfera) in PCM
   MXTS  = max number of tesserae in PCM

   MXABC = max number of A,B,C matrices in the COSMO
           algorithm.  The default value of 6000 allows
           the construction of cavities for roughly 150
           to 200 atoms.




Names of source code modules
 
     The source code for GAMESS is divided into a number of 
sections, called modules, each of which does related 
things, and is a handy size to edit.  The following is a 
list of the different modules, what they do, and notes on 
their machine dependencies.

UNIX versions use the C code ZUNIX.C for dynamic memory.

    The machine dependencies noted above are:
1) packing/unpacking           2) OPEN/CLOSE statments
3) machine specification       4) fix total dynamic memory
5) subroutine walkback         6) error handling calls
7) timing calls                8) LOGAND function
10) vector library calls      11) REAL*16 data type


Note that the message passing support (DDI) for GAMESS is 
implemented in C (for most machines), and is stored in a 
separate subdirectory.  Please see the ~/games/ddi tree for 
more information about the Distributed Data Interface's 
code and usage.



Programming Conventions
 
         The following "rules" should be adhered
         to in making changes in GAMESS.  These
         rules are important in maintaining
         portability, and should be adhered to.

    The following rule is so important that it is not given 
a number,

    The Golden Rule: make sure your code not only has no 
compiler diagnostics (try as many compilers as possible), 
but that it also has no FTNCHEK diagnostics.  The FTNCHEK 
program of Robert Moniot is a fantastic debugging tool, and 
results in the great portability of GAMESS.  You can learn 
how to get FTNCHEK, and how to use it from the script
            ~/gamess/misc/checkgms
 
    Rule 1.  If there is a way to do it that works on all 
computers, do it that way.  Commenting out statements for 
the different types of computers should be your last 
resort.  If it is necessary to add lines specific to your 
computer, PUT IN CODE FOR ALL OTHER SUPPORTED MACHINES. 
Even if you don't have access to all the types of supported 
hardware, you can look at the other machine specific 
examples found in GAMESS, or ask for help from someone who 
does understand the various machines.  If a module does not 
already contain some machine specific statements (see the 
above list) be especially reluctant to introduce 
dependencies.
 
    Rule 2.  Write a double precision program, and let the 
source activator handle any conversion to single precision, 
when that is necessary:
  a) Use IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION(A-H,O-Z) specification 
statements throughout.  Not REAL*8.  Integer type should be 
just INTEGER, so that compiler flags can select 64 or 32 
bit integers at compile time.
  b) All floating point constants should be entered as if 
they were in double precision, in a format that the souce 
code activator can recognize as being uniquely a number.  
Namely, the constants should contain a decimal point, a 
number after the decimal, and a signed, two digit exponent.  
A legal constant is 1.234D-02.  Illegal examples are 1D+00, 
5.0E+00, 3.0D-2.  Check for illegals by
         grep "[0-9][DE][0-9]" *.src
         grep "[0-9][.]D" *.src
         grep "[0-9][.][0-9][DE][0-9]" *.src
         grep "[0-9][DE][+-][1-9][^0-9]" *.src
  c) Double precision BLAS names are used throughout, for 
example DDOT instead of SDOT, and DGEMM instead of SGEMM.

         The source code activator ACTVTE will
         automatically convert these double
         precision constructs into the correct
         single precision expressions for machines
         that have 64 rather than 32 bit words.

    Rule 3.  FORTRAN 77 allows for generic functions.  Thus 
the routine SQRT should be used in place of DSQRT, as this 
will automatically be given the correct precision by the 
compilers.  Use ABS, COS, INT, etc.  Your compiler manual 
will tell you all the generic names.

    Rule 4.  Every routine in GAMESS begins with a card 
containing the name of the module and the routine.  An 
example is "C*MODULE xxxxxx  *DECK yyyyyy".  The second 
star is in column 18.  Here, xxxxxx is the name of the 
module, and yyyyyy is the name of the routine.  This rule 
is designed to make it easier for a person completely 
unfamiliar with GAMESS to find routines.

    Rule 5.  Whenever a change is made to a module, this 
should be recorded at the top of the module.  The 
information required is the date, initials of the person 
making the change, and a terse summary of the change.

    Rule 6.  No imbedded tabs, statements must lie between 
columns 7 and 72, etc.  In other words, old style syntax.

                       * * *

         The next few "rules" are not adhered to
         in all sections of GAMESS.  Nonetheless
         they should be followed as much as
         possible, whether you are writing new
         code, or modifying an old section.

    Rule 7.  Stick to the FORTRAN naming convention for 
integer (I-N) and floating point variables (A-H,O-Z).  If 
you've ever worked with a program that didn't obey this, 
you'll understand why.
 
    Rule 8.  Always use a dynamic memory allocation routine 
that calls the real routine.  A good name for the memory 
routine is to replace the last letter of the real routine 
with the letter M for memory.
 
    Rule 9.  All the usual good programming techniques, 
such as indented DO loops ending on CONTINUEs, IF-THEN-ELSE 
where this is clearer, 3 digit statement labels in 
ascending order, no three branch GO TO's, descriptive 
variable names, 4 digit FORMATs, etc, etc.
 
         The next set of rules relates to coding
         practices which are necessary for the
         parallel version of GAMESS to function
         sensibly.  They must be followed without
         exception!
 
    Rule 10.  All open, rewind, and close operations on 
sequential files must be performed with the subroutines 
SEQOPN, SEQREW, and SEQCLO respectively.  You can find 
these routines in IOLIB, they are easy to use.  SQREAD, 
SQWRIT, and various integral I/O routines like PREAD are 
used to process the contents of such files.  The variable 
DSKWRK tells if you are processing a distributed file (one 
split between all compute processes, DSKWRK=.TRUE.) or a 
single file on the master process (DSKWRK=.FALSE., 
resulting in broadcasts of the data from the master to all 
other CPUs).
 
    Rule 11.  All READ and WRITE statements for the 
formatted files 5, 6, 7 (variables IR, IW, IP, or named 
files INPUT, OUTPUT, PUNCH) must be performed only by the 
master task.  Therefore, these statements must be enclosed 
in "IF (MASWRK) THEN" clauses.  The MASWRK variable is 
found in the /PAR/ common block, and is true on the master 
process only.  This avoids duplicate output from the other 
processes.
 
    Rule 12.  All error termination is done by "CALL ABRT" 
rather than a STOP statement.  Since this subroutine never 
returns, it is OK to follow it with a STOP statement, as 
compilers may not be happy without a STOP as the final 
executable statment in a routine.  The purpose of calling 
ABRT is to make sure that all parallel tasks get shut down 
properly.




Parallel broadcast identifiers
 
    GAMESS uses DDI calls to pass messages between the 
parallel processes.  Every message is identified by a 
unique number, hence the following list of how the numbers 
are used at present.  If you need to add to these, look at 
the existing code and use the following numbers as 
guidelines to make your decision.  All broadcast numbers 
must be between 1 and 32767.

Disk files used by GAMESS

   These files must be defined by your control language in 
order to execute GAMESS.  For example, on UNIX the "name" 
field shown below should be set in the environment to the 
actual file name to be used.  Most runs will open only a 
subset of the files shown below, with only files 5, 6, 7, 
and 10 used by every run.  Files 1, 2, 3 (both), 4, 5, 6, 
7, and 35 contain formatted data, while all others are 
binary (unformatted) files.  Files ERICFMT, EXTBAS, and 
MCPPATH are used to read data into GAMESS.  Files MAKEFP, 
TRAJECT, RESTART, and PUNCH are supplemental output files, 
containing more concise summaries than the log file for 
certain kinds of data.

Unit 301 is used for direct access using an internally

disk files in parallel runs

When a file is opened by the master compute process (which 
is rank 0), its name is that defined by the 'setenv'.  On 
other processes (ranks 1 up to p-1, where p is the number 
of running processes), the rank 'nnn' is appended to the 
file name, turning the name xxx.Fyy into xxx.Fyy.nnn.  The 
number of digits in nnn is adjusted according to the total 
number of processes started.  Thus the common situation of 
a SMP node sharing a single disk for several processes, on 
up to the case of a machine like the Cray XT having only 
one disk partition for all nodes does not lead to file name 
conflicts.

By the way, only the master process needs to read the 
environment to learn file names: these names are sent as 
network messages to the other processes.

When DDI subgroups are not in use, the variable DSKWRK (in 
common /par/) defines the strategy.  A large file like 2e- 
AO integrals (AOINTS) is computed as several smaller files, 
which taken together have all the integrals.  When all 
processes are supposed to process files private to each 
process, DSKWRK is .TRUE., and every process has a file, 
usually containing different values.  For smaller data, 
such as CI vectors, where all processes want to store 
exactly the same data, only the master process needs to 
maintain the file.  This situation is DSKWRK=.FALSE.  When 
the data is to be recovered from disk, only the master 
process reads the disk, after which, the data is sent as a 
broadcast message to all other processes.  The special file 
DICTNRY is always processed in this second way, so data 
recovered from it is the same (to the least significant 
bits) on every process.  Another example of a file read by 
only one process is the run's INPUT file.

If DDI subgroups are used, DSKWRK is ignored, and every 
process opens every file.  These are often left empty, 
except on the master process in each subgroup.  The input 
file (INPUT) is exempt from having the rank added to its 
name, so that a machine with a common file system can have 
all processes read from the same input file.  If the groups 
have different disks, the INPUT must be copied to the 
master process of every group: a simple way to ensure that 
is to copy INPUT to every node's work disk.  Similarly, the 
OUTPUT file (and a few other files like PUNCH) are written 
by every group master.  If the run goes badly, these extra 
output files may be interesting, but most of the time the 
OUTPUT from the master of the first subgroup has enough 
information.  The OUTPUT of non-group-masters is not very 
interesting.

The DICTNRY file is also treated in a special way when 
running in groups, and that should be described here.

    In order to correctly pass data between different 
machine types when running in parallel, it is required that 
a DAF record must contain only floating point values, or 
only integer values.  No logical or Hollerith data may be 
stored.  The final calling argument to DAWRIT and DAREAD 
must be 0 or 1 to indicate floating point or integer values 
are involved.  The records containing integers are so 
marked in the list below.
 
    Physical record 1 (containing the DAF directory) is 
written whenever a new record is added to the file.  This 
is invisible to the programmer.  The numbers shown above 
are "logical record numbers", and are the only thing that 
the programmer need be concerned with.
